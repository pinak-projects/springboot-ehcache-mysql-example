   <!-- Default Cache configuration. These will applied to caches programmatically created through
            the CacheManager.
            The following attributes are required:
           
            maxElementsInMemory            - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
            eternal                        - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
                                             element is never expired.
            overflowToDisk                 - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                                             has reached the maxInMemory limit.
           
            The following attributes are optional:
           
            timeToIdleSeconds              - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
                                             i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
                                             Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                             Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
                                             The default value is 0.
            timeToLiveSeconds              - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
                                             i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
                                             Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                             Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
                                             The default value is 0.

            memoryStoreEvictionPolicy      - Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
                                             policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
                                             First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Least Frequently Used
                                             (specified as LFU)
